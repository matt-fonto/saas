# SaaS basics

## 1. Fundamentals

1. Product Last, Marketing First

- Modest product + strong marketing
- Think long and hard how to sell, market your product

2. Wrong business model will sink you before you start

- B2B is better than B2C

| Feature                | B2B        | B2C       |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| ARPC                   | $50-$5k/mo | $5-$20/mo |
| Churn rate             | low        | high      |
| Revenue predictability | stable     | volatile  |
| Marketing budget       | high       | low       |

- ARPC: Average Revenue per Customer

3. The problem the SaaS solves is the foundation of everything

- "Don't tell me what your idea is, tell me what problem it solves and for whom"
- Start with a problem, solve it well for a small group, then grow from there
