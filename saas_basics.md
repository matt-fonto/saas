# SaaS basics

## 1. Fundamentals

1. Product Last, Marketing First

- Modest product + strong marketing
- Think long and hard how to sell, market your product

2. Wrong business model will sink you before you start

- B2B is better than B2C

| Feature                | B2B        | B2C       |
| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| ARPC                   | $50-$5k/mo | $5-$20/mo |
| Churn rate             | low        | high      |
| Revenue predictability | stable     | volatile  |
| Marketing budget       | high       | low       |

- ARPC: Average Revenue per Customer

3. The problem the SaaS solves is the foundation of everything

- "Don't tell me what your idea is, tell me what problem it solves and for whom"
- Start with a problem, solve it well for a small group, then grow from there

## 2. How to build SaaS

1. Do I have any unfair advantages?

- Network: trumps audience with SaaS
- Audience
- Early in a workspace
  - Doing things in public creates opportunity

2. Start with a problem

- Keep a notebook with problems you'd like to have solved + proposed solutions
- The diary of problems

3. Move from problems to solutions

- One problem can have multiple solutions

4. Evaluate solutions

- Problem
  - Is it important and urgent?
  - Is it a painkiller (aspirin) or just a nice-to-have (vitamin)?
  - Focus on solving real, pressing usse, not just building a cool idea
- Purchaser
  - Who is the buyer?
  - Do they adopt new tech?
  - Are they willing and able to pay?
  - Are they B2C, B2B, enterprise, or aspirational?
- Pricing model
  - Does it fit a subscription model?
  - What's the estimated ARPA (Average Revenue per Account)?
  - Is it monthly, annual, usage-based, or rev-share?
- Market
  - What's the total recheable market?
  - How easy is it to reach customers?
  - Is the market growing, stable, or declining?
  - What's the level of competition?
- Product-Founder fit
  - Do you have domain knowledge, tech/marketing chops, or a network?
  - Do you care enough about the problem to stick with it?
- Pain to validate
  - How easy is it to test the idea?
  - Can you validate with conversations or a simple MVP?
  - Is it a long, expensive process to prove demand?

5. X-factor | How's your solution different?

- How are you different?
- Product differentiation contributes to faster growth
  - Value add
  - Unique features
  - Positioning

6. Talk to potential customers

- Are they willing to pay for this?
- The mom test [book]

  - Emphasizes not specific questions, but principles to get honest, useful feedback

  1. Ask about past behavior:
     How did you solve [problem] the last time it happened? | Focus on what they've done, not what they might do

  2. Ask about problems, not ideas:
     What's the hardest part about [process/task]? | Discover the real pain points

  3. Ask for specific examples:
     Can you walk me through the last time you did that? | Get concrete details, not guesses

  4. Ask about frequency & impact
     How often does this happen? How much does it cost you (time/money)? | Validate if the problem is worth solving

  5. Avoid pitching, stay curious
     Why is that a problem? What else have you tried? Learn how serious the issue is and what alternatives exist

- Avoid false positives

7. Start marketing before coding

- Landing page + capture emails of interested people

8. Start building MVP

- Smallest thing possible to provide value
- You have certainty only when you're in the market
